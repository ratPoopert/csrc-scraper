    "Description": "The JUNOS-FIPS-L2 Cryptographic Module is a multi-chip standalone cryptographic module (for Juniper Networks T-Series and M-Series routers) that executes JUNOS-FIPS firmware. JUNOS-FIPS is a release of the JUNOS operating system, the first routing operating system designed specifically for the Internet. JUNOS is currently deployed in the largest and fastest-growing networks worldwide. A full suite of industrial-strength routing protocols, flexible policy language, and leading MPLS implementation efficiently scale to large numbers of network interfaces and routes.",
