        "Module Name": "HP TippingPoint Crypto Core NSS",
        "Standard": "FIPS 140-2",
        "Status": "Historical",
        "Historical Reason": "Moved to historical list in accordance with SP800-131A Revision 1 Transition (AES/TDES key wrapping)",
        "Overall Level": 1,
        "Caveat": "When operated in FIPS mode and when obtained, installed, and initialized as specified in Section 5 of the provided Security Policy. For Red Hat Linux 6.2, Section 5 also specifies the precise RPM file containing this module. The integrity of the RPM is automatically verified during the installation and the Crypto officer shall not install the RPM file if the RPM tool indicates an integrity error. For CentOS 5.6 the module is compiled from source available from Mozilla. Any deviation from the specified verification, installation and initialization procedures will result in a non FIPS 140-2 compliant module. The module generates cryptographic keys whose strengths are modified by available entropy",
