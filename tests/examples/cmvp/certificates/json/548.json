        "Description": "The ID-One Cosmo 64 v5 is a JavaCard cryptographic module with dual interface (ISO 7816 & ISO 14443) specifically designed for identity and government market needs. It offers a full 64K Byte of EEPROM space available for customer discretionary use, together with on card cryptographic services such as TDES, AES, Elliptic Curve and 2048-bit RSA algorithms with on-card key generation. It is compliant to Java Card v2.2 and Open Platform v2.1.1A. To protect against skimming, a built-in firewall allows application developers to disable contactless access for sensitive operations. Additional features include On- Card fingerprint matching and Logical Channels. The ID-One Cosmo 64 v5 is available in contact only, dual interface, or contactless only formats.",
