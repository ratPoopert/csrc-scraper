  "Details": {
    "Module Name": "Luna速 Backup HSM Cryptographic Module",
    "Standard": "FIPS 140-2",
    "Status": "Historical",
    "Historical Reason": "186-2 transition",
    "Overall Level": 3,
    "Caveat": "When operated in FIPS mode and initialized to Overall Level 3 per Security Policy",

      "Mitigation of Other Attacks: N/A"
    ],
    "Module Type": "Hardware",
    "Embodiment": "Multi-Chip Stand Alone",
    "Description": "The Luna速 Backup HSM Hardware Security Module (HSM) provides the same level of security as the Luna速 SA and Luna速 PCI-E HSMs in a convenient, small, low-cost form factor. The Luna Backup HSM ensures that sensitive cryptographic material remains strongly protected in hardware even when not being used. One can easily back up and duplicate keys securely to the Luna Backup HSM for safekeeping in case of emergency, failure or disaster.",
