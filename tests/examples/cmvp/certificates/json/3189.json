  "Details": {
    "Module Name": "REDCOM Encryption 140-2",
    "Standard": "FIPS 140-2",
    "Status": "Historical",
    "Historical Reason": "SP 800-56Arev3 transition",
    "Overall Level": 1,
    "Caveat": "When operated in FIPS mode. The module generates cryptographic keys whose strengths are modified by available entropy. No assurance of the minimum strength of generated keys",

      "Physical Security: N/A"
    ],
    "Module Type": "Software",
    "Embodiment": "Multi-Chip Stand Alone",
    "Description": "REDCOM Encryption 140-2 is a fully FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic engine for Java and Android based environments. The module delivers core cryptographic functions to these platforms and features robust algorithm support, including Suite B algorithms. REDCOM Encryption 140-2 offloads functions for secure key management, data integrity, data at rest encryption, and secure communications to a trusted implementation. **Oracle and Java are registered trademarks of Oracle and/or its affiliates. **Android is a trademark of Google Inc",
